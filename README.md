GoF defines it as 
“Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.”

let’s also bring in the definition of factory method – 
“Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate”

Look at these words:
		Factory Method –   an object and 
		Abstract Factory - families of related and dependent object.

It means the Factory Method is used to create only one product  that is deals with instantiating only one required sub class

but Abstract Factory is about creating families of related or dependent products which means a single abstract factory can instantiate multiple sub classes
